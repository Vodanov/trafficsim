# TrafficSim

A small program that uses **Raylib** to draw stuff.  
Intended to simulate city traffic and life (eventually).

## Requirements

- Raylib
- CMake (for easier building â€” you can use any build system if you really want to)

## Compiling

Create a folder named `build` and run:

```bash
cd build/
cmake ..
make
???
profit
```
